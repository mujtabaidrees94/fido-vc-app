## Overview

This monorepo contains two complimentary repositories frontend and backend to provide a demo on how the FIDO protocol can be extended to support verifiable credentials. The following projects are maintained here:

- [fido-vc-backend](fido-vc-backend)
- [fido-vc-ui](fido-vc-ui)

A fork of webauthn project is also included as a submodule that contains the necessary changed we make at the protocol and libraries layer to support VC layer:

- [fido-vc-webauthn](fido-vc-webauthn)

See these subproject' READMEs for more specific implementation information.
